| **Server Code 1**       | The iquery server works as expected with _dig_ using the `+noedns` option, as documented in the code. Great job! Server-side print statements are very helpful in exposing what is happening and the code is straightforward to navigate.<br><br>One small source setup touch that would have been nice is the use of a _requirements.txt_ file to encode the need for installing the `python-dotenv` package. This was easy enough for me to figure out eventually, but some steps could have been saved by having that available for a no-brainer `pip install`. No deduction because this falls into the realm of specific tech stack conventions; just passing this along FYI in case you encounter projects with similar needs in the future. |       18/18 |
| **Client Code 1**       | The client runs as expected, though perhaps error handling could have been better. Showing the raw `ValueError` stack trace would have been relatively easy to avoid.<br><br>Multiple-query implementation also seems incomplete with the client—a valid response is received _every other_ query, with the ones in between just receiving an empty byte array. I didn’t have time to dig into this to track it down but I figured I’d just report it.<br><br>Overall, these are minor glitches considering the scope of the overall endeavor, so this is purely given as feedback with no deduction.                                                                                                                                              |       18/18 |
| **Locust Suite 1**      | Good mix of tasks in Locust suite, overall runs as expected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |         8/8 |

| **Locust Commentary 1** | Thanks for the information and observations! Good job investigating the `nodename nor servname` error—I agree, this is likely correlated to the `Too many open files` error also. Oh well, we can’t help that when we’re on a single machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |         4/4 |
| **Server Code 2**       | The query server works as expected, just like the iquery server. Both _dig_ and _nslookup_ worked with it—as it should as an accurate workalike! Again, making the `python-dotenv` requirement more turnkey would have been nice but isn’t a spoiler. Well done overall.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |       18/18 |
| **Client Code 2**       | Same feedback for the query client as for the iquery one (error handling, multiple-query behavior), which as stated there is perfectly OK from a points perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |       18/18 |
| **Locust Suite 2**      | Similarly appropriate and well-implemented task suite for Locust as with the iquery service; I should also add, good job navigating the binary aspect of the DNS protocol across all of the work—this was handled very well considering that it wasn’t covered expressly in class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |         8/8 |

| **Locust Commentary 2** | Similar observations as for iquery, not surprising given that they are internally very similar in terms of computational scope.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |         4/4 |
